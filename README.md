a collection of bash apps that I've worked on


```mkYear.sh <startYYYY> <endYYYY>```

for each year within the inclusive range, a YYYY parent directory is created along with 12 YYYYMM subdirectories.

```mvDir.sh```

for each directory that is 8 char in length (assumed to be in format YYYYMMDD), create a related YYYY directory and YYYYMM subdirectory and move that folder and its contents inside that subdirectory.
